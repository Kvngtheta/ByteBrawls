# The Archive That Lies — Part 1

## Story
A “simple attachment” came through, but everyone who tried to inspect it got different answers.
Your job: extract the truth.

## Objective
Find and submit the flag in the format:
`FLAG{...}`

## Rules
- You may use standard CLI analysis tools (e.g., `file`, `strings`, hex viewers, basic scripting).
- No internet required.
- Don’t brute-force anything — the solution is deterministic.

## File
- `The_archive_that_lies_part1.dat`

## Notes
The file may not be what its extension suggests. Treat it like an artifact and validate what it really is.
